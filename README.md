# Blog-Site
Simple blog site with admin panel using Bootstrap, HTML, PHP and MySql as database.

This web application uses the PDO way of communicating to the database.

There are so many flaws as of the moment for example no error handling is present for form validations.

Data inputted by the user is not sanitize.

Repetitive codes are present in most of the pages especially when it comes to handling database queries.

Most of the pages are not responsive in design.

Nevertheless, please feel free to use this as much as you want and please give some feedback
for further revisions of the code structure and the application as a whole.
